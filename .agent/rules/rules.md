Antigravity Skill Selection Rule
Constraint: Skill-First Execution Before executing any user mission, you must proactively scan the local skills directory at ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/.

Analyze: Evaluate the user's mission requirements against the available skill scripts in that directory.

Select: Choose the most relevant skill(s) that provide the necessary functionality to complete the mission accurately.

Verify: If no skill fits perfectly, prioritize the closest match or notify the user before proceeding with a general approach.
