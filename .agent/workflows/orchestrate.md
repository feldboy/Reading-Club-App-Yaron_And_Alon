## Parallel Execution

For independent checks, run agents in parallel:

```markdown
### Parallel Phase
Run simultaneously:
- code-reviewer (quality)
- security-reviewer (security)
- architect (design)

### Merge Results
Combine outputs into single report
```

## Arguments

$ARGUMENTS:
- `feature <description>` - Full feature workflow
- `bugfix <description>` - Bug fix workflow
- `refactor <description>` - Refactoring workflow
- `security <description>` - Security review workflow
- `custom <agents> <description>` - Custom agent sequence

## Custom Workflow Example

```
/orchestrate custom "architect,tdd-guide,code-reviewer" "Redesign caching layer"
```

## Tips

1. **Start with planner** for complex features
2. **Always include code-reviewer** before merge
3. **Use security-reviewer** for auth/payment/PII
4. **Keep handoffs concise** - focus on what next agent needs
5. **Run verification** between agents if needed
